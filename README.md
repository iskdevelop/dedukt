# DeduKt: Language of Reasoning

**Version 0.0.1 (Draft)**

DeduKt is an open-source, community-driven system designed for computer algebra, simulation, and data manipulation. It provides a dynamic and expressive language for modeling and defining mathematics, leveraging Kotlin as the main development language and including a library for symbolic computation.

## Overview

DeduKt addresses the limitations of existing Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) by offering a transparent, extensible, and rigorous platform for mathematical reasoning. Unlike proprietary systems that operate as "black boxes," DeduKt provides complete visibility into computational processes while maintaining strict mathematical precision.

## Mission Statement

DeduKt empowers users to compute and manipulate mathematical expressions within their correct contextual framework, emphasizing intelligent reasoning throughout the computational process. The system bridges the gap between theoretical mathematics and real-world data analysis, enabling seamless integration of symbolic computation with experimental data handling.

## Key Features

- **Extensible Framework**: Modular architecture for mathematical computation and symbolic manipulation
- **Transparent Computation**: Complete audit trails of logical steps and derivations
- **Strict Type System**: Rigorous mathematical consistency through static analysis
- **Data Integration**: Powerful toolkit for data manipulation, processing, and visualization
- **Intelligent Reasoning**: Automated assistance in proof development and theorem generation
- **Open Source**: Free, community-driven development under Apache License 2.0

## Design Principles

DeduKt is built on six fundamental principles:

1. **Transparency**: Complete visibility into computational processes and reasoning steps
2. **Strict Typing and Rigor**: Uncompromising mathematical precision through formal structure
3. **Minimalism**: Elegant expression of mathematical thought without unnecessary complexity
4. **Extensibility**: Modular architecture enabling unlimited growth and customization
5. **Flexibility**: Adaptive framework accommodating diverse mathematical domains
6. **Layered Development**: Hierarchical construction mirroring mathematical practice

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- Researchers and academics in mathematics and physics
- Scientific engineers and data analysts
- Open-source contributors interested in symbolic computation
- Developers integrating symbolic computation into applications

### Secondary Users
- Students in computational mathematics or theoretical physics
- Data science and machine learning practitioners requiring symbolic computation

## The Pure Form Language

DeduKt includes Pure Form, an intuitive programming language designed specifically for mathematical expression. Pure Form features:

- **Intuitive Syntax**: Natural alignment with mathematical notation and thinking patterns
- **Expressive Power**: Comprehensive representation of complex mathematical concepts
- **Unambiguous Interpretation**: Precise, deterministic evaluation of all constructs
- **Type Safety**: Prevention of mathematical inconsistencies through static analysis
- **Object-Oriented Mathematical Modeling**: Sophisticated abstraction and inheritance mechanisms

## Current Status

DeduKt is currently in **Phase 0: Syntax and Interpreter** development, focusing on:

- User-experience research on readable mathematical scripts
- Development of DeduKt grammar and syntax
- Implementation of interpreter, parser, and lexer components

### Phase 0 Expected Outcomes
- Simple arithmetic operations with variables
- Benchmarked interpreter and parser performance
- Concrete syntax definition and documentation
- Functional evaluation of basic mathematical expressions
