\section*{Abstract}

DeduKt is an open-source, community-driven system designed for computer algebra, simulation, and data manipulation.
It provides a dynamic and expressive language for modeling and defining mathematics, leveraging Kotlin, a modern, statically typed, general-purpose language, as the main development language.
Additionally, DeduKt includes a library for symbolic computation within Kotlin, enabling both native integration and advanced mathematical reasoning.
