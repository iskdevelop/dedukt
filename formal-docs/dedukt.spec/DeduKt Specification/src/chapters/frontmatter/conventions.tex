\section*{Conventions and Notation}\label{sec:conventions-and-notation}

\subsection*{Hierarchical Organization}\label{subsec:hierarchical-organization}
The document is structured using a clear hierarchical system:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Chapters} represent major topics and are numbered sequentially
    \item \textbf{Sections} divide chapters into primary subtopics
    \item \textbf{Subsections} provide further subdivision of complex topics
    \item \textbf{Subsubsections} offer detailed breakdowns when necessary
\end{itemize}

All theorems, definitions, examples, and other mathematical constructs are numbered within their respective chapters using the format \texttt{Type Chapter.Number} (e.g., Definition 2.1, Theorem 3.5).

\subsection*{Special Environments}\label{subsec:special-environments}

The document employs several specialized environments to categorize different types of content:

\begin{definition}
    Formal definitions of terms, concepts, and mathematical objects are presented in definition boxes like this one.
    Definitions establish precise meanings for terminology used throughout the document.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}
    Mathematical statements that have been proven are presented as theorems.
    Each theorem is numbered and may be referenced throughout the document.
\end{theorem}

\begin{lemma}
    Supporting results that aid in proving larger theorems are presented as lemmas.
    These are typically smaller, focused results.
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}
    Direct consequences of theorems or lemmas are presented as corollaries, representing results that follow immediately from previously established facts.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proposition}
    Mathematical statements of intermediate importance, less significant than theorems but more substantial than simple observations, are presented as propositions.
\end{proposition}

\begin{example}
    Concrete illustrations and applications of definitions, theorems, and concepts are provided in example environments to demonstrate practical usage.
\end{example}

\begin{axiom}
    Fundamental assumptions or rules that are accepted without proof are presented as axioms, forming the foundation for logical reasoning.
\end{axiom}

\begin{remark}
    Additional commentary, observations, or clarifications that supplement the main content are provided in remark environments.
\end{remark}

\begin{note}
    Important observations, warnings, or supplementary information that readers should particularly notice are highlighted in note environments.
\end{note}

\subsection*{Specialized Content Boxes}\label{subsec:specialized-content-boxes}

Three types of specialized content boxes are used for domain-specific material:

\begin{deduktcode}
    Code examples, syntax demonstrations, and programming constructs specific to the Dedukt system are presented in these highlighted code boxes. The syntax highlighting helps distinguish between different language elements.
\end{deduktcode}

\begin{inferenceBox}
    Formal inference rules, logical derivations, and reasoning patterns are presented in inference rule boxes.
    These typically show the structure of logical arguments and deductive steps.
\end{inferenceBox}

\begin{critique}
    Critical analysis, limitations, potential issues, or alternative viewpoints are presented in critique boxes.
    These provide balanced perspective and highlight important considerations.
\end{critique}

\subsection*{Mathematical Notation}\label{subsec:mathematical-notation}
Mathematical expressions follow standard conventions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Variables are typically represented by lowercase italic letters: $x, y, z, a, b, c$
    \item Constants are represented by specific symbols or uppercase letters when contextually clear
    \item Functions are denoted by lowercase letters followed by parentheses: $f(x), g(y), h(z)$
    \item Sets are represented by uppercase italic letters: $A, B, C, S, T$
    \item Mathematical operators follow standard notation: $+, -, \times, \div, =, \neq, <, >, \leq, \geq$
\end{itemize}

Standard set theory symbols are used consistently:

\begin{align}
    \emptyset &\quad \text{empty set} \\
    \in &\quad \text{element of} \\
    \notin &\quad \text{not an element of} \\
    \subset &\quad \text{proper subset} \\
    \subseteq &\quad \text{subset or equal} \\
    \cup &\quad \text{union} \\
    \cap &\quad \text{intersection} \\
    \setminus &\quad \text{set difference} \\
    |A| &\quad \text{cardinality of set } A
\end{align}

Logical operators and quantifiers follow standard conventions:
\begin{align}
    \neg &\quad \text{negation (not)} \\
    \land &\quad \text{conjunction (and)} \\
    \lor &\quad \text{disjunction (or)} \\
    \rightarrow &\quad \text{implication (if-then)} \\
    \leftrightarrow &\quad \text{biconditional (if and only if)} \\
    \forall &\quad \text{universal quantifier (for all)} \\
    \exists &\quad \text{existential quantifier (there exists)} \\
    \exists! &\quad \text{unique existence (there exists exactly one)}
\end{align}

When discussing the Dedukt system specifically, certain conventions apply:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dedukt expressions are typeset in monospace font within the text: \texttt{expr}
    \item Multi-line Dedukt code is presented in dedicated code environments
    \item Dedukt keywords and operators retain their system-specific syntax
    \item Type annotations and signatures follow Dedukt's formal specification
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Typographical Conventions}\label{subsec:typographical-conventions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Bold text} indicates important terms, key concepts, or emphasis
    \item \textit{Italic text} is used for mathematical variables, technical terms being defined, or subtle emphasis
    \item \texttt{Monospace text} represents code, system commands, filenames, or literal computer input/output
    \item \textsf{Sans-serif text} is used sparingly for interface elements or modern technical terms
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Internal references use descriptive text with hyperlinks to relevant sections, theorems, or definitions
    \item External references follow standard academic citation format
    \item Theorem and definition references include both number and descriptive context when helpful
    \item Code listings and figures are numbered and may be referenced by number
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Inline code uses monospace formatting: \texttt{variable\_name}
    \item Code blocks preserve original formatting and include syntax highlighting where applicable
    \item Mathematical expressions within code environments maintain monospace formatting
    \item Output examples are clearly distinguished from input code
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Visual Design Principles}\label{subsec:visual-design-principles}

The document's visual design emphasizes clarity, consistency, and accessibility:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Primary accent color is used consistently for headings, borders, and highlights
    \item High contrast ensures readability in both print and digital formats
    \item Color coding in syntax highlighting follows conventional programming standards
    \item Color is never the sole means of conveying information
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Consistent vertical spacing between elements maintains visual rhythm
    \item Code blocks are clearly separated from surrounding text
    \item Mathematical expressions are properly spaced for readability
    \item White space is used effectively to group related content and separate distinct concepts
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Sharp corners and clean lines reflect modern, minimal design principles
    \item Border weights are consistent across similar element types
    \item Background colors provide sufficient contrast without overwhelming the content
    \item Title bars clearly identify the purpose of specialized environments
\end{itemize}
