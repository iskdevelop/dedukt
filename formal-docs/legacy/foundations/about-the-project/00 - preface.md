# Preface
In mathematics and the natural sciences, computers serve not only as powerful tools for simulations and numerical computation but also as essential systems for symbolic manipulation of mathematical expressions. Despite the many existing Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) and simulation software available today, a gap remains between the need for symbolic flexibility and computational performance. This gap is where _DeduKt_ finds its place.

_DeduKt_ is an open-source, community-driven system designed for computer algebra, simulation, and data manipulation. It provides a dynamic and expressive language for modeling and defining mathematics, leveraging Kotlin, a modern, statically typed, general-purpose language, as the backbone for both its core functionality and its extensibility. Through its unique approach, DeduKt aims to unify symbolic and numerical computation, enabling an adaptable framework suitable for academic, research, and practical applications alike.

While numerous powerful software systems like Wolfram Mathematica, COMSOL, and SageMath dominate the computational landscape, they often suffer from limitations such as cost, complexity, and closed-source nature. DeduKt stands as an open alternative, offering both the flexibility and extensibility needed for modern computational workflows. It aims to break free from the constraints of proprietary software, ensuring that users have complete control over their computational environment while benefiting from the power and robustness of a community-driven open-source platform.

At its core, DeduKt is designed to be a hybrid tool that can be used both as a standalone software package and as a Kotlin library, enabling seamless integration into existing Kotlin-based workflows. With _Kompute_, DeduKt's numerical computing counterpart, the system supports a wide range of applications—from symbolic computation to advanced simulation tasks—while maintaining a focus on performance, usability, and scalability.

This document outlines the foundational secifications of DeduKt, its system architecture, design philosophy, and road map for implementation. It will also delve into the legal, community, and branding aspects of the project, reinforcing its status as an open, collaborative effort. The goal of this document is to provide both a technical and philosophical understanding of DeduKt's vision and its place within the larger landscape of computational tools.

As a community-driven project, DeduKt's future is shaped by the contributions and feedback of its users. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or educator, DeduKt offers a flexible, extensible, and powerful tool set for advancing computational mathematics and science.
