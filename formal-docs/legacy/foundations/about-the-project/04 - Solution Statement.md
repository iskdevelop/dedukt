# DeduKt: A Solution for Modern Symbolic Reasoning and Computation

## Executive Summary

The landscape of symbolic computation and mathematical reasoning software is dominated by systems that, despite their capabilities, suffer from fundamental limitations that hinder modern mathematical research, education, and application development. Proprietary solutions like Mathematica and MATLAB impose significant barriers through closed-source architectures, restrictive licensing, and vendor lock-in. Open-source alternatives like SageMath, while avoiding proprietary constraints, suffer from performance limitations, architectural complexity, and inadequate development environments due to their foundation on interpreted languages and legacy design decisions.

**DeduKt** represents a paradigm shift in symbolic computation, designed from the ground up to address these fundamental limitations through modern language design principles, robust software architecture, and a commitment to both mathematical rigor and practical usability. Built on Kotlin's solid foundation, DeduKt provides a comprehensive solution that combines the mathematical expressiveness required for advanced research with the performance, maintainability, and extensibility demanded by modern software development.
## Problem Analysis: The Need for a New Approach
### Fundamental Issues with Current Solutions
The comprehensive analysis of existing symbolic computation systems reveals systemic problems that cannot be addressed through incremental improvements:
