# Introduction 

**DeduKt Pure** (or simply DeduKt referring to the language and not the project) is inspired by languages like **Kotlin**, **Go**, and **Haskell**, combining their expressive strengths with a custom syntax designed for symbolic reasoning, proof verification, and numerical evaluation. This language is versatile, extending from basic symbolic manipulations (such as differentiation and simplification) to complex mathematical constructs (like tensor operations or modular arithmetic).

The core philosophy behind DeduKt is a **structure-first** approach, where mathematical constructs are treated as composable structures, rather than isolated functions or expressions. This model enables **symbolic computation**, enabling **rigorous proof generation** and **intelligent reasoning** over algebraic expressions.

This document provides an overview of **DeduKt’s syntax** and **grammar**. It covers the basic lexical structure, operators, expressions, and advanced constructs used within the language. It is intended for both developers building DeduKt-based tools and end-users looking to understand the language’s capabilities and syntax.
